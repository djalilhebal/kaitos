## Well-known tags

- `#archived` (with an optional timestamp) means the page is archived on Wayback Machine.
    * `#archived/TIMESTAMP`

- `#saved` means it should (but not guaranteed) have been saved locally (web page saved, repo cloned, video downloaded, etc.).

- `#read` means something is readable, like an article or a book.

- `#todo`, `#doing`, and `#done`.

    - `[opinion:VAL]` val &in; `{ disliked, meh, ok/average, fine, liked, loved }`.
    - `[rewatched]` and `[rewatchable]`.
