# My coding style


## Style guides

I like the following style guides and generally try to follow them:

- [Airbnb's JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

- Google's Java

- Google's Bash

- And that guy's Git commit guide.
    * [ ] KAITO: Who again?


## Naming

I sorta like the idea of the "Hungarian notation"...

- `HTMLElement` variables start with `$` (Ã  la jQuery), as in `const $age = document.querySelector('input[name="age"]')`.

- RegEx identifiers start with `r`, as in `const rCode = /^[A-Z]{2}$/`

- Unused params start with `_` (as the Refactoring JavaScript book recommends).

- `k` is my namespace, as in `[k:opinion:liked]` or `<k-animated-image>`.
