# My files

It is somewhat inspired by BEM. \
Examples:
- `reads__books--done/`.
- `watch/movies--done/` or `watch__movies--done/`.

Folder = directory.


## Repo: Common

Common files in my repos:

- `README.md`
- `Ramblings.md`: Like `README` but contains (more) random and incomplete thoughts.

- `TODO.md`
- `TODREAM.md`: Like `TODO` except we won't do them. Just keep dreaming, you know.

- `src/`
- `scrap/` (AKA `junk/`): Like `src/` but contains random and incomplete snippets and pseudocode.

### Initial `.gitignore`

```gitignore
node_modules/

*#private/
*#new/
*#learn/
*#saved/

__junk/
__learn/
__saved/
```


## Folders

- `@` folders contain a specific creator's files:
  * `songs/VOCALOID/@Aya_me/*.mp4`  
  For example, songs (covers) by **Aya_me** like [【Aya_me】« AVARITIA : Les jugements corrompus »『悪徳のジャッジメント』【French Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXxKJD-tAh4).

  * `games/@ncase/*`  
    Games by [NCase.me](https://ncase.me).

  * `reads/@Protocol Labs/*.pdf`  
  Example: Whitepapers like Protocol Labs like [Filecoin: A Decentralized Storage Network](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf).

- `#` folders contain a specific 'series':
  * `songs/VOCALOID/#The Evillious Chronicles/*.mp4`  
  This may include **Aya_me**'s French covers of _The Evillious Chronicles_ or other songs/covers like
  [Daughter of Evil - English Cover by Ketsuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYJATjB88lI)
