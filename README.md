# Kaitos

**Kaitos** is Kaito's ~~monstrosity~~ UI library, design system, content strategy, or whatever you wanna call it.

- Note to self: #blunderland and #wonderland both refer to this thing.

## Name

You know the deal, as a dev, you should name your project after a mythical character.

**Phoenix** (Apache Phoenix),
**Sphinx** (CMU Sphinx, Sphinx documentation generator),
**Apollo** (Apollo GraphQL) and **Cassandra** (Apache Cassandra),
**Kerberos** (MIT Kerberos),
etc.

I picked **Kaitos**, as in Cetus the sea monster from Greek mythology. \
Get it? Cetus, Zeta Ceti, Baten Kaitos (the star or constellation or whatever), and ultimately referencing [the game of the same name][baten-kaitos-imdb] (its main character is a cool blue-haired guy, GET IT?!).

### Names considered

Blunderland and Kaitos were the main candidates.

#### npm scope

npm namespaces (users or orgs):

- ~~simplex~~

- ~~wonderland~~
- [ ] blunderland, but GitHub user exists.
- [ ] ineptitude, but it's long, kinda negative, and doesn't describe the project.
- ~~glacier~~ as in "Might as well try to hustle a glacier".

- ~~kaito~~
- [ ] kaitos, but GitHub user exists.
- ~~kaizen~~ https://github.com/cultureamp/kaizen-design-system

- ~~trainwreck~~ as in "trainwreck of thought".

## Principals

The principal is simple: The user is frustrated and short-tempered, so get straight to the point. \
Automated whatever is automatable. \
Set sensible defaults when it makes sense. \

Keep it simple and plain (flat?).

Still, you should use visual metaphors.
